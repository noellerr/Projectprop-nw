    <h1>Final Project Proposal: PyPong (need a creative name)</h1>
        <p>By: Noelle Woods</p>
        <p>Hello, this is my final project proposal where I will explain some 
            parts of the project.</p>
    <h2>Overview: </h2>
        <p>Essentially, pong is a two person game where the user's goal is to control the paddle 
            and play the puck across the center line without their opponent recieving it. 
            Winner is the side with the most points 
            against the other.
        </p>
    <h3>Technology Overview:</h3>
        <p>To create this game I will be using a library called pygame which 
            is popular for game programs</p>
    <h3>Feature List: </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>A running application of pong using pygame</li>
            <li>A score counter</li>
            <li>Different colored paddles</li>
    <h4>Future Possibilites: </h4>
        </ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Sounds for when puck hits wall</li>
            <li>Start/Exit Buttons</li>
    <h5>Basic Features: </h5>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>create a display and input where the puck and paddle appear. </li>
        <li>Detecting collision of the ball</li>
        <li>Calculations and physics ball, paddle, and wall. I will have to 
            implement functions to do this.
        </li>
    <h5>Advanced Features:</h5>
    <p>One feature that I am uncertain of it that this will have to use trigonometric functions
        for the puck, paddle, and wall set up. 
    </p>
